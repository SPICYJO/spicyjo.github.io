I have finished reading the first story of Harry Potter series. I have read it a long time ago in Korean version when I was a kid. Recently I wanted to read it again and decided to read it in English version this time. It was fun to read again and I was able to understand meaning of "Leaky Cauldron". When I was reading in Korean version, it was just translated as it sound so I couldn't understand the literal meaning of the name. After reading English version, now I can understand what the name means.

## Plot

Harry Potter lost both of his parents when he was just a little baby. Evil wizard, Voldemort murdered his parents but strangely he failed to get rid of Harry. After that, Harry was raised by his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon Dursley. He often was mistreated by Dursleys. Their kid, Dudley pinched and prodded Harry everyday. Harry hasn't received any present whatsoever in his life. One day, invitation from wizard school Hogwart changed his entire life.

He went to Hogwart and made friends. He also found his knack for flying a broomstick and won a Quidditch match. He also fended off Voldemort from the Sorcerer's stone which give a person an endless life. Voldemort has retreated and the semester in Hogwart ended. Harry returned to Dursley's house in vacation. He had wonderful time in Hogwart.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed reading this book. See you in the next post!
