Hello, blog! I started my tech blog as one of my New Year's resolutions.

I have been working as a software engineer for about a year. On my first day at work, there were so many things I didn't know. So I had to struggle a lot to figure out how our software works. In the process, I learned lots of knowledge and gained experience. And I thought that that kind of journey could be a lot easier when someone who has gone before share their insights and experiences.

I think everyone has difficult time when they try something new. And that's the reason I started this tech blog. I don't have decades of job experience yet, but still I can be helpful to someone else. I always keep this quote in my mind: `"You are never too old to learn and never too young to teach."`

If you have any question, comment or discussion, **please feel free to leave a comment**. I also like this quote: `"There are no stupid questions."`

Yey! I finished my first post. See you later.
