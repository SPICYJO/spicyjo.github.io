I am trying to improve my English by writing some post in my blog. Since I am learning English as my second language, any feedback is welcomed. Thank you for reading.

I watched the movie "The Founder" which is about the story of McDonald's founders. I didn't know much about the McDonald's behind story until I watch this movie. I knew that Ray Kroc was the CEO but I never doubted why his name isn't McDonald. He purchased the fast food company from the McDonald brothers. The detailed process was quite surprising. I think business world always has fierce competition. He used everything in his arsenal to make the McDonald his: lawyers, land holdings company, milkshake powders, and etc. To become a businessman it would be better to be prepared.

Here are some impressive quotes from the movie.

```
Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliche. Education won't. Why the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.
```

```
While you two boys were content to sit back and become a couple of also-rans... I wanna take the future. I wanna win. And you don't get there by being some "aw shucks" guy sap. There's no place in business for people like that. Business is war. It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat. If my competitor were drowning, I'd walk over and put a hose right in...
```

Mac, I'm the president and CEO of a major corporation with land holdings in 17 states... You run a burger stand in the desert. I'm national. You're fucking local.
```

## New words I learned

- Letterhead: heading at the top of a sheet of letter paper
- over the hill: old and past one's prime
- also-ran: a loser in a race or other contest, especially by a large margin.
