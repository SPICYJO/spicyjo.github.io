I watched the original Star Wars trilogy last weekend. It was so fun and I was surprised with the film. I couldn't believe that each movie has been released at 70s and 80s. 

It would be shocking to people who is reading my blog but I haven't watched any of the Star Wars movie until now. Well, I have watched few scenes from television and knew several things such as lightsaber and Yoda but I haven't watched the entire movie. It should be quite shocking considering the franchise's popularity. After doing some research about this, I have found that Episode 5 of the Star Wars wasn't released at the time in South Korea. So Korean people who watched the series at that time would have watched Episode 4, skipped Episode 5, and then watched Episode 6. No wonder it would not make much sense if someone watches movie in this way. People says that this would be the main reason why Star Wars franchise haven't grown its popularity in South Korea compared to other countries.

Anyway I decided to watch the series, since there are a lot of Star Wars memes, fans, games, and movies. I wanted to get to know the movie. And last weekend was very well spent watching this amazing series. I turned off the subtitles of the movie so I didn't understand 100% of the movie scenes but it helped me improve my English listening skills. It was quite hard for me to understand what Yoda was saying because he has a quite unique way of structuring his sentences.

## Episode 4: A New Hope

The Empire, which is the evil side in the movie, has built the deadly Death Star which have a huge power that can obliterate an entire planet. Princess Leia has stolen the design document of the weapon which contains the flaw of its defense system. She gave robot R2-D2 the document to bring it to Rebellion force. Two robots, R2-D2 and C-3PO, crashed on the planet where Luke Skywalker was living in. Ben Skywalker, a Jedi warrior and an uncle of Luke, joined the journey to deliver the document to Rebellion with Luke and two robots. They successfully delivered the document to Rebellion force and stopped the Empire from destroying Rebellion's base planet by counter-attack on Death Star.


## Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back

Rebellion has escaped from the Empire but the Empire dispatched many patrols to locate the Rebellion. Rebellion's base has been found and they evacuated. Darth Vader, who is in charge of the Empire force, set a trap to confront Luke face to face so that he can make Luke his side. In lightsaber fight between Luke and Darth Vader, Darth Vader told Luke that he is actually a son of his. Luke is quite shocked and also seriously injured during the fight. He managed to escape the battle. The Rebellion is in the crisis because Luke has lost his arm, Han Solo has been captured in the carbonite, the Rebellion is on the run.

## Episode 6: Return of the Jedi

Force is a universal power that rules the universe in the movie. And Jedis are people who can control the Force in a good way. There are two sides of the Force: light side and dark side. Emperor and Darth Vader are people who use the Force of dark side. Luke has felt that his father, Darth Vader still has a light side in his mind deep inside when he confronted him. He decided to confront him again so that he can turn him to the light side. Finally, Darth Vader defeated the evil Emperor and shortly he lost his life. It was quite touching moment because he turned into the right side at the end. The Jedi in the title must be Darth Vader who turned into the right side at the end.


I really enjoyed watching the original trilogy of Star Wars. I will watch the prequel trilogy when I get some free time. Thank you for reading my review. See you in the next one!
