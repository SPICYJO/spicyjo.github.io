I have just finished reading the second book of the Harry Potter series. It's still exciting after many years since it has been published.

## Plot

Harry Potter hasn't got any mails or news from his friends while he is staying in the Dursleys. He encountered the house elf Dobby in the middle of Dursley's evening dinner with very important guest. Dobby ruined the dinner by making fuss and Harry get grounded inside his room. One day, Ron came to take him to his home driving a flying car with his brothers. Harry found out that Dobby has been hiding letters from his friends. Spending some time in Weasley's, Harry and Ron went to the train station to get aboard the Hogwarts Express. However they couldn't enter the station. So they flew to Hogwarts with a car which is against the school rules and get them into some troubles.

During semesters, students at the Hogwarts has been attacked and found petrified. Hermione was also found petrified. But she found out clue of the hideous monster who are attacking students in the notes inside her clenced hand. Harry found out that note and realized that the monster is a basilisk, the giant serpent which can kill people with stares. Basilisk were hidden in the chamber of secrets. And Ginny, Ron's younger sister has opened the chamber bewitched by Tom Riddle's diary. Tom Riddle was Voldemort's old name which he used in his youth. Harry and Ron who now solved the riddle headed to the chamber and confronted the basilisk and Tom Riddle. Tom Riddle was just a memory inside the diary, but it has gained its appearance by taking Ginny's soul. Harry and Fawkes the Pheonix teamed up to fend off the basilisk. Harry took Gryffindor's sword out of the sorting hat and stabbed basilisk to the hilt. Basilisk has been defeated and Tom Riddle was also destroyed by putting basilisk's fang into the diary.

Ginny has been saved and Dumbledore thanked Harry for brining peace to the school. Harry used little trick to Lucius Malfoy, master of Dobby to free Dobby. Lucius gave Dobby a sock which means act of giving freedom. Dobby has been freed. Attacked students all recovered their health. And the semester of Hogwarts ended. 


## Conclusion
