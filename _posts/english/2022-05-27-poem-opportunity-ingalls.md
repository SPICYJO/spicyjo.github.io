Today I read some impressive poem. Since I want to keep that poem in my mind, I am going to post it on my blog. I wish to have some wisdom to figure out the right moment and seize the opportunity in my future. Below is the poem of John James Ingalls. John James Ingalls was an American politician who served as a senator from Kansas.

Opportunity
By John James Ingalls

Master of human destinies am I.
Fame, love, and fortune on my footsteps wait.
Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate
Deserts and seas remote, and passing by
Hovel, and mart, and palace—soon or late
I knock unbidden once at every gate!

If sleeping, wake—if feasting, rise before
I turn away. It is the hour of fate,
And they who follow me reach every state
Mortals desire, and conquer every foe
Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,
Condemned to failure, penury, and woe,
Seek me in vain and uselessly implore—
I answer not, and I return no more.
```
