    I joined SNU in 2014, and thoroughly enjoyed both studying and extracurricular activities. I took a leave from the school for military service. After my service in military, I returned back to the school and decided to double major in computer science because I liked computer systems and programming and I wanted to study deeper into it.

    During my time at SNU, I learned a variety of skills such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines as well as course subjects. I also met lots of  friends and faculties in SNU who inspire me and motivate me everyday.

    I enjoyed my free time participating as a member of the *SNU Judo Club* taking on role such as *Captain*.
