    I worked as a research intern in Human Robot Interaction Research Section, Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory, ETRI. I reimplemented [exsiting gaze estimator](https://github.com/swook/GazeML "GazeML github link") written with Tensorflow in PyTorch. I also developed semi-automatic annotation program, AuTag from scratch with PyQt5. I annotated real-world data with AuTag. I trained and evaluated gaze estimator with both [synthetic data](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes "UnityEyes link") and the real-world data.
