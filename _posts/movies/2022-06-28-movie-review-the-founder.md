I am trying to improve my English by writing some post in my blog. Since I am learning English as my second language, any feedback is welcomed. Thank you for reading.

I watched the movie Glory this month, which is a movie about the Civil War. Recently I became interested in US history after playing Red Dead Redemption 2. And I accidently watched a short scene from this movie on Youtube which made me watch the entire movie. Not only I learned several historic facts, I was pretty impressed from them. And as a man who had some experience in US army, it was also pretty interesting to hear most of drill commands which are still used in the Army. I was also deeply touched by soldier's passion for liberty and officer's bearing the responsibility.

## Liberty: What the soldiers deeply craved

Background of the movie is 19th century when the slavery still existed. Some black people had become free and some hadn't. The South didn't want to abolish the slavery. The North guranteed the abolishment of slavery if they win. Consequently lots of black people were willing to fight alongside the North, yet many leaders of the North were reluctant to give them chances to join their army.

Desipte some officer's reluctance the North decided to recruit a regiment of black soldiers. And a lot of black people, freed or not, voluteered more than willingly. It was heartbreaking to watch them training for a battle. The commander of the regiment was especially harsh on his soldiers. He trained his unit strong and maintained discipline with admonishment and punishment. And soldiers followed his orders no matter how difficult it is because they wanted freedom so long. They were willing to sacrifice their own comforts and pleasures to get ready for battles so that they can win their freedom.

They fought fiercely and gloriously during the assault on Fort Wagner. Their assault had failed to defeat Fort Wagner. However, their demonstration of courage spurred Congress to authorize the raising of black soldiers throught out the Union which helped to turn the tide of the war.

## Responsibility: What the officers have to take

The commanding officer of the regiment was strict with his unit. He had been to a dangerous battle which obsessed him to train his unit ready to fight. In his letter to his mother he seemed to be warm-hearted. But with his soldiers he was tough and fair. When one of his soldiers, whom he grew up together, was mentally and physically suffering from harsh training pleaded for a personal conversation with him, he demanded a formal procedure for conversation with him. It is appropriate decision since having a personal relationship with soldiers is prohibited as fraternization and it could lead to negative effect in the unit's morale.

Officers and soldiers both have a common goal, to win the war. They just have different roles for the same goal. Officers are responsible to take care of their units, to make them ready to fight, and to command them to victory in a battle. It was heartbreaking to watch the commander being strict and harsh to his men. Nonetheless it is the right choice and the responsible act.


## Ending note

I was impressed watching this movie. I also learned some facts about the Civil War. I would recommend people to watch this movie.
