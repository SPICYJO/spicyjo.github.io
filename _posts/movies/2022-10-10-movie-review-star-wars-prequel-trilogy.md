I watched the prequel Star Wars trilogy this weekend. I was impressed with the vast plot of the series. After watching the series, Darth Vader looks like the protagonist of the Star Wars franchise. Also some says that the series could be seen as an allegory of the World Wars and the advent of Fascism. Little did I know that viewpoint, I found that interpretation very interesting. I really enjoyed the movies.

## Episode 1: The Phantom Menace

There was a dispute between Trade Federation and Planet of Naboo. Jedi Obiwan Kenobi and Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn were dispatched to resolve the dispute. In their mission, they were attacked by droid army sent by Trade Federation and they managed to flee with Padme Amidala, the Queen of Naboo. Their ship was damaged and they landed Tatooine to get some parts for their ship. They encountered Anakin Skywalker, a slave boy who had massive potential to become a Jedi. Qui-Gon believed that he is 'Chosen one', prophesied to bring the balance of the force. And he freed Anakin and Anakin joined the group. Later in the battle, Qui-Gon was mortally wounded by Darth Maul. Kenobi defeated Maul and Qui-Gon asks Kenobi to train Anakin before his death.


## Episode 2: Attck of the Clones

Count Dooqu, former Jedi Master organized Separatist movement in the Galatic Republic. Senator Padme Amidala who insisted to create an army to support Jedi to keep the Republic's peace became a target of assasination. Narrawly avoiding the attempt, Jedi counsel decided to protect her with Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Anakin fell in love with Padme while he is protecting her. Obi-wan took a trip to find out the assanssin and found out bounty hunter named Jango Fett was the assassin. He also discovered that clone army was being made. Meanwhile Anakin was having a nightmare about his mother. He took a trip to Tatooine to find his mother. He found out his mother was abducted by Tusken Raiders. He went to rescue his mother but his mother died in his arms because of the injury. Anakin massacres the entire tribe including women and children. Later in the movie, Obi-wan and Anakin confronted Count Dooqu but they were defeated with serious injury. Master Yoda confronted Count Dooqu but Count Dooqu managed to flee.

## Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith

Anakin suffers from nightmare of losing people who he loves. He became obssessed to gain power so that he can save Padme. Chancellor Palpatine who is a Sith Lord seduced Anakin to the dark side of the Force using his desire to gain more power. Anakin becomes Darth Vader, apprentice of Darth Sidious who was actually Chancellor Palpatine. Anakin massacres Jedi younglings, separatists. Darth Sidious ordered clone army to turn against Jedi which led to deaths of many Jedi. Yoda confronted Darth Sidious but failed to defeat him. Obi-wan confronted Anakin and defeated him. Anakin was not dead after the battle and Darth Sidious gathered his body and his life was extended with life support system and armors. Padme gave births to twins, Leia and Luke, whose father was Anakin. Padme passed away shortly after giving births. The twins were separated and sent to safe place to hide from Sith.

I really enjoyed watching the prequel trilogy. Thank you for reading my review. See you in the next post!
