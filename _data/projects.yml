    I have worked in a logistics warehouse as an operator of Put-to-Light system when I was a college student. Put-to-Light system was pretty interesting to me. So I decided to make a simple mobile game with Unity engine. I had no experience in Unity and C#, but it was a good opportunity to learn them. Two friends who used to play music with me joined the game development. They created artworks, background music and sound effects for the game. Actually, one of the background music was played by me with a wind instrument Xaphoon.

    Our team consisted of 5 persons including me made this app as a class project in SNU. I developed location based service in the app. It was my first development project as a team and learned lots of things such as teamwork using GitHub, design patterns and new language Kotlin.
